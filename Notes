CTCONST
	A word can be flagged as returns a constant. When compiling
    a reference to such a word execute it and compile the 
	resulting literal.

	I tested it and it works fine ( change bootstrap interpreter
	and compile, in core.fth. Also patchup the disassembler etc. )

	This flag can be applied to constants, fake-variables and 
	variables ( buffers too? ).

	It's a speed optimization which I'm not really considering
	right now favoring simplicity. It doesn't save any space
	which is my main consideration atm. ( since a literal
	and a call are usually 1 byte opcode 2 bytes value anyhow )


Wire		endTransmission is supposed to return a status
